# Emergency Vs Non Emergency Vehicle Sound Classification

## Description  
This project classifies sounds into **emergency** and **non-emergency vehicle sounds** using deep learning. A neural network is trained on sound data to automatically distinguish sirens and alarms from regular traffic noises.  

## Files  
- `Emergency vs Non Emergency Vehicle Sound Classification.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter notebook with the full implementation  
- Data files (sound datasets used for training and testing)  
- Additional code files for preprocessing and model training (if added later)  

## Features  
- Preprocessing of vehicle sound datasets  
- Neural network model for classification  
- Performance evaluation of the trained model
